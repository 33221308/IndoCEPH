IndoCEPH, designed to support the development of robust AI solutions for quantitative morphometric analysis. 
IndoCEPH includes 1,246 cephalometric radiographs with 17 anatomical landmarks from the Indonesian population, 
selected through a rigorous process and tested for inter-observer reliability, 
as well as evaluated for deep learning model performance. 
The IndoCEPH dataset was used to train the deep learning algorithm. We conducted experiments using the YOLOv9 algorithm!
